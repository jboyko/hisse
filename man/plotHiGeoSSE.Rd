\description{A plotting function for visualizing changes in states and rates over a phylogeny}
\usage{
\method{plot}{higeosse.states}(x, rate.param, do.observed.only=TRUE, rate.colors=NULL, 
state.colors=NULL, edge.width.rate=5, edge.width.state=2, type="fan", 
rate.range=NULL, show.tip.label=TRUE, fsize=1.0, lims.percentage.correction=0.001,
legend="tips", legend.position=c(0, 0.2, 0, 0.2), legend.cex=0.4, 
legend.kernel.rates="auto", legend.kernel.states="auto", 
legend.bg="cornsilk3",...)
}       
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{hisse.states} object or a list of such objects.}
\item{rate.param}{indicates the type of rates to plot. Options include: \dQuote{turnover}, \dQuote{net.div}, \dQuote{speciation},  \dQuote{extinction},  \dQuote{extinction.fraction}.}
\item{do.observed.only}{a logical indicating whether just the states should be plotted; for now, only TRUE works.}
\item{rate.colors}{user specified colors to be used for coloring rates.}
\item{state.colors}{user specified colors to be used for coloring states.} 
\item{edge.width.rate}{the width of the rate lines.} 
\item{edge.width.state}{the width of the state lines, which should be set so that it is narrower than the edge width for rates.}
\item{type}{a character string specifying the type of phylogeny to be drawn. See \code{ape} for options, default is a circle tree ("fan").}
\item{rate.range}{an optional two element vector. If present, specifies the range of rate values to use for plotting.}
\item{show.tip.label}{a logical indicating whether tip names should be included.}
\item{fsize}{sets the font size for the tip labels.}
\item{lims.percentage.correction}{deals with cases where the limits are slightly smaller than the values due to imprecision issues.}
\item{legend}{indicates the type of legend. Options include: \dQuote{none}, \dQuote{traditional}, \dQuote{tips}, \dQuote{internal}, \dQuote{all}.}
\item{legend.position}{the coordinates for placing the legend.}
\item{legend.cex}{the text size inside the legend.}
\item{legend.kernel.rates}{for legend=tips, internal, or all, lets you specify the way the density plot or histogram is made for rates. \dQuote{auto}
chooses what we think is the best option given your data, \dQuote{hist} makes a histogram, \dQuote{rectangular}, \dQuote{gaussian}, and others make a density plot. See \code{?density} for all non-\dQuote{hist} options.}
\item{legend.kernel.states}{as above, for states.}
\item{legend.bg}{sets the color for the legend background.}
\item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to \dQuote{plot} or \dQuote{plot.hisse.states}.}

\details{
Provides phylogeny that shows a heat map of the diversification rate parameter you specify (which could be turnover, net.div, speciation, extinction, or extinction.fraction).
The discrete state reconstruction appears as lines on top of the heat map. If you give a single hisse.state object, it uses that; if you give it a list of them, it will 
model-average the results (it assumes the trees are the same). Colors can be specified by sending a vector of colors to rate.colors or state.colors (the defaults
are red to blue for rate and white to black for state). You can specify two or more colors: c("red", "gray", "blue") for example. By default the visualization uses the
minimum rate on the tree for the minimum color, and the maximum rate for the maximum color, but you may want to use the same color scale across models, even
if some of them have a smaller range than others. To do this, pass a vector with the minimum and maximum rate across all models to the visualization for all models
and they will use the same scale. There are many options for adding a legend. A traditional legend showing what values a color corresponds to is \dQuote{traditional}, like
what plotSimmap will show in phytools. However, we can also use the legend to show the distribution of values, rather than just a key to color. \dQuote{tips} shows a density
plot of states or rates at tips, \dQuote{internal} a distribution at internal nodes, and \dQuote{all} at all nodes in the tree. For the density or histogram plots, you can
let the package pick the best visualization or choose yourself whether to use a histogram or density plot, and if the latter, what kernel you want. The legend can be
moved around the overall tree plot by using \dQuote{legend.position}: this is a vector that specifies the \dQuote{fig} argument to \dQuote{par}: c(x1, x2, y1, y2), where
the values are the starting and ending positions as a fraction of the overall plot. By default, the legend starts at the lower left corner and continues up 20% into 
the rest of the plot (c(0, 0.2, 0, 0.2)): by changing values, you can make the legend larger or smaller and change its position. The heatmap code is modified slightly
from Liam Revell's phytools package.

Note that the examples trees generated in diversitree, which are detailed in other functions, will cause this function to throw an error. We are still working on why this occurs. But, these phy objects can be saved to another file, reuploaded, brought into MarginRecon, and then plotted with this function just fine.
