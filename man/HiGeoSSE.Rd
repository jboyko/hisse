\usage{
HiGeoSSE(phy, data, f=c(1,1,1), speciation=c(1,2,3), extirpation=c(1,2), 
hidden.areas=FALSE, trans.rate=NULL, assume.cladogenetic=TRUE, 
condition.on.survival=TRUE, root.type="madfitz", root.p=NULL, sann=FALSE,

}       
\arguments{
\item{phy}{a phylogenetic tree, in \code{ape} \dQuote{phylo} format and
    with internal nodes labeled denoting the ancestral selective regimes.}
\item{data}{a matrix (or dataframe) with two columns containing species
  information. First column has the species names and second column has
  area codes. Values for the areas need to be 0, 1, or 2, where 0 is
  area A, 1 is area B and 2 is the widespread area AB. See 'Details'.}
\item{f}{vector of length 3 with the estimated proportion of extant
  species in areas 0 (or AB), 1 (or A), and 2 (or B) that are included
  in the phylogeny. A value of c(0.25, 0.25, 0.5) means that 25 percent
  of species in areas AB and A and 50 percent of species in area B are
  included in the phylogeny. By default all species are assumed to be
  sampled.}
\item{speciation}{a numeric vector of length equal to 3+(number of
  \code{hidden.areas} * 3). A GeoSSE model has 3 speciation parameters:
  s0, s1 and s01. A HiGeoSSE model with one hidden area has 6 speciation
parameters: s0A, s1A, s01A, s0B, s1B, s01B. And so on. The length of the numeric
vector needs to match the number of speciation parameters in the
model. See 'Details'.}
\item{extirpation}{a numeric vector of length equal to 2+(number of
  \code{hidden.areas} * 2). A GeoSSE model has 2 extirpation parameters:
  x0 and x1. A HiGeoSSE model with one hidden area has 4 extirpation
parameters: x0A, x1A, x0B, and x1B. And so on. The length of the numeric
vector needs to match the number of extirpation parameters in the
model. See 'Details'.}
\item{hidden.areas}{a logical indicating whether the model includes a
  hidden area. The default is \code{FALSE}.} 
\item{trans.rate}{provides the transition rate model. See function
  \code{TransMatMakerHiGeoSSE}.}
\item{assume.cladogenetic}{assumes that cladogenetic events occur at nodes. The 
	default is \code{TRUE}.}
\item{condition.on.survival}{a logical indicating whether the likelihood
  should be conditioned on the survival of two lineages and the
  speciation event subtending them (Nee et al. 1994). The default is \code{TRUE}.}
\item{root.type}{indicates whether root prior assumption should based
  the procedure described by FitzJohn et al. 2009, \dQuote{madfitz},
  assumed equal, \dQuote{equal}, or set to user, \dQuote{user}.}
\item{root.p}{a vector indicating fixed root state probabilities. The
  default is \code{NULL}.}
\item{sann}{a logical indicating whether a two-step optimization
  procedure is to be used. The first includes a simulate annealing
  approach, with the second involving a refinement using
  \code{subplex}. The default is \code{FALSE}.}
\item{sann.its}{a numeric indicating the number of times the simulated
  annealing algorithm should call the objective function.}
\item{bounded.search}{a logical indicating whether or not bounds should
  be enforced during optimization. The default is is \code{TRUE}.}
\item{max.tol}{supplies the relative optimization tolerance to
  \code{subplex}.}
\item{mag.san.start}{UNCLEAR WHAT THIS DOES! ASK JEREMY!}
\item{starting.vals}{a vector of starting values to be used instead of
  the default settings. NEED MORE INFO ON THIS!}
\item{speciation.upper}{sets the upper bound for the speciation parameters.}
\item{extirpation.upper}{sets the upper bound for the extirpation parameters.}
\item{trans.upper}{sets the upper bound for the transition rate parameters.}
\item{ode.eps}{sets the tolerance for the integration at the end of a
  branch. Essentially if the sum of compD is less than this tolerance,
  then it assumes the results are unstable and discards them. The
  default is set to zero, but in testing a value of 1e-8 can sometimes
  produce stable solutions for both easy and very difficult optimization problems.}

\details{
This function sets up and executes the HiGeoSSE model. The model closely
follows \code{diversitree}, although here we employ modified
optimization procedures. As for data file format, \code{HiGeoSSE}
expects a two column matrix or data frame, with the first column
containing the species names and the second containing the are
information. The area information need to be in the format of three
numbers: 0 for area A, 1 for area B, and 2 for widespread area (i.e.,
AB). Please note that the code for the areas here differ from the
\code{make.geosse} function of package \code{diversitree}.
The order of the data file and the names in the
\dQuote{phylo} object need not be in the same order; \code{hisse} deals
with this internally. Also, the character information MUST be 0,
1, or 2, otherwise, the function will misbehave.

To setup a model, users input vectors containing values to indicate how
many free parameters are to be estimated for each of the variables in
the model. This is done using the \code{speciation} and
\code{extirpation} parameters. One needs to specify a value for each of
the parameters of the model, when two parameters show the same value,
then the parameters are set to be linked during the estimation of the
model. For example, a HiGeoSSE model with 1 hidden area and all free
parameters has \code{speciation = 1:6}. The same model with
speciation rates constrained to be the same for all hidden areas has
\code{speciation = c(1,2,3,1,2,3)}. This same format applies to
\code{extirpation}. Please note that HiGeoSSE currently works with up to
4 hidden areas. The most complex model would be \code{speciation = 1:15}
and \code{extirpation = 1:10}.

Once the model is specified, the parameters can be estimated using the
subplex routine (default), or use a two-step process (i.e., sann=TRUE)
that first employs a stochastic simulated annealing procedure, which is
later refined using the subplex routine.

The \dQuote{trans.rate} input is the transition model and has an
entirely different setup than speciation and extirpation rates.
See \code{TransMatMakerHiGeoSSE} function for more details. 

For user-specified \dQuote{root.p}, you should specify the probability
for each area. If you are doing a hidden model, there will be six areas:
0A, 1A, 2A, 0B, 1B, 2B. So if you wanted to say the root had to be in
area 0 (widespread distribution), you would specify \dQuote{root.p =
  c(0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0)}. In other words, the root has a 50\% chance
to be in one of the areas 0A or 0B.
